## Websockets

A very first websockets game. You are the black circle. Eat the red circles, don't get eaten by the blue circles.

Many, many todo tasks. In no particular order...

* not very efficent in data sent
* should deal with different screen sizes
* should do something else after player gets eaten
* should use a user-freindly name instead of socket ids when displaying messages to the user
* procedurally generate red food dots so each client sees the same dots.
* Generate new dots as they are being eaten
* increase player's volume, not radius, when dot eaten
* don't create new user on top of other users, check for a free space on the game board
* many other things
* scores, save high scores, high score table
